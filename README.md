Compliance thinking (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI)

*Pipeline security
Snyk / Trivy / Checkmarx
SonarQube (security rules)

*Kubernetes security
RBAC hardening
NetworkPolicies
Pod Security Standards
Admission controllers

*Secrets & IAM
HashiCorp Vault

Threat modeling
IAM (AWS IAM, Azure AD)
Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

*CI/CD security
GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
SAST, DAST, SCA tools
(Snyk, Trivy, SonarQube, Checkmarx)

*Cloud + containers
AWS or Azure (security services matter more than deep coding)
Docker
Kubernetes (security focus: RBAC, network policies)

*Infrastructure as Code
Terraform (read & modify > writing complex modules)
Policy as Code (OPA, Sentinel – light scripting)
